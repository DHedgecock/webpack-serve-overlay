# webpack-serve-overlay

A rudimentary overlay for webpack-serve, based off the one used in `webpack-dev-server`.

This overlay is currently in development. It's fully working, 
but has none of the clever automagical features like inserting itself into `webpack.entries`.

These features (and more) should hopefully come with time. Right now this package serves as a quick fully functional way of 
being able to have the same overlay as `webpack-dev-server` in `webpack-serve` with minimal fuss & expense.
